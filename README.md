<h2 align="left">Ahoy there. I'm Kushagra.</h2>


  As a student with a solid technical foundation, I’ve realized that web development is my true calling, with a particular love for frontend tech. Yet, my journey doesn’t stop there—I’m diving into .NET MVC Core, eager to blend my frontend skills with the power of backend solutions.



  Growing up in the early 2000s, I was captivated by the internet, and that fascination has evolved into a passion for building fast, responsive, and accessible digital experiences. My goal is to create intuitive, user-friendly websites and applications that solve real-world problems and empower collaboration.
